NumPy:
NumPy stands for Numerical Python. NumPy is used for working with arrays. It is used to create matrices that can be applied to ML models.

Tensorflow:
TensorFlow is a platform for ML with data flow graphs. Data flow graphs are structures that define how data flows through a set of processing nodes.

Keras:
Keras is a library that provides an interface for artificial neural networks. It is a high level API used to solve machine learning problems.

Sklearn
Scikit-learn is a machine learning and statistical modelling library in Python.

Pytorch:
Pytorch is a library  used for natural language processing applications, computer vision, and deep learning.PyTorch can be utilised in the computer neural network to develop object detection, generative application, and image classification.
